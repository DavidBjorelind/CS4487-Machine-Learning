    "## Goal\n",
    "In this assignment, the task is predict whether a comment about a YouTube video is spam or not.  Here are some examples of spam and not spam:\n",
    "  - **spam**: _\"Huh, anyway check out this you[tube] channel: kobyoshi02\"_\n",
    "  - **not spam**: _\"Still watching this 2 years later?\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to train a classifier to predict whether a comment is spam or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "You need to train classifiers using the training data, and then predict on the test data. You are free to choose the feature extraction method and classifier algorithm.  You are free to use methods that were not introduced in class.  You should probably do cross-validation to select a good parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation on Kaggle\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to submit your test predictions to Kaggle for evaluation.  A portion (~50%) of the test data will be used to show your ranking on the live leaderboard.  After the assignment deadline, the remaining portion will be used to calculate your final ranking. The entry with the highest final ranking will win a prize!  Also the top-ranked entries will be asked to give a short 5 minute presentation on what they did.\n",
    "\n",
    "To submit to Kaggle you need to create an account, and use the competition invitation that will be posted on Canvas.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** You can only submit 2 times per day to Kaggle!\n",
    "\n",
    "## What to hand in\n",
    "You need to turn in the following things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This ipynb file `Assignment1.ipynb`, containing your source code and documentation. _**You should write about all the various attempts that you make to find a good solution.**_\n",
    "2. Your final submission file to Kaggle.\n",
    "3. The ipynb file `Assignment1-Final.ipynb`, which contains the code that generates the final submission file that you submit to Kaggle.  **This code will be used to verify that your Kaggle submission is reproducible.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Files should be uploaded to Assignment 1 on Canvas.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading\n",
    "The marks of the assignment are distributed as follows:\n",
    "- 40% - Results using various classifiers and feature representations.\n",
    "- 20% - Trying out feature representations (e.g. adding additional features) or classifiers not used in the tutorials.\n",
    "- 20% - Quality of the written report.  More points for insightful observations and analysis.\n",
    "- 20% - Final ranking on the Kaggle test data (private leaderboard). If a submission cannot be reproduced by the submitted code, it will not receive marks for ranking.\n",
    "- **Late Penalty:** 25 marks will be subtracted for each day late.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** you should start early! Some classifiers may take a while to train.\n",

      "I absolutely adore watching football plus I’ve started earning income with out risk from claiming bonus deals. It’s a weird technique where you put money on something with one bookmakers and put money against it on Betfair. You acquire the bonus as income . A lad named Jim Vanstone is selecting the wagers free on his website Vanstone Secrets (Google it!). I have generated about 600 quid so far. And it’s free. I assume the bookmakers pay him to get new men and women, but it succeeds.\n",

A chap named Jim Vanstone is finding the wagers free on his own website Vanstone Secrets (Google it!). I’ve made about 500 quid thus far. And it is cost-free. I guess the bookies pay him to obtain new consumers, yet this actually works.\n"
