    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The course project is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Predicting outcomes of schizophrenia patient\n",
    "\n",
    "> The goal is to predict the 12-year outcomes of patients with schizophernia using 3-years of data collected after the first diagnosed episode.  The dataset contains two prediction tasks: 1) predict Suicide death within 12 year time-span; 2) predict treatment resistance to antipsychotic medication (if a patient becomes resistant to medication, than another medication Clozapine is prescribed). A good prediction model would help create early treatment models to identify potential future problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "> There are two types of data: 1) cross-sectional data consists of patient measurements taken at a specific time point (12 years after the first diagnosis); 2) longitidual data consists of 3 years of measurements after the first episode.  For this problem, the cross-sectional data contains the class we want to predict.  The longitudinal data contains baseline information and monthly reports of symptoms and functioning for the first 3 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You only need to select one of these tasks (mortality or treatment resistance) for the course project. \n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">_**NOTE: This dataset is provided by the Psychiatry department HKU and contains some sensitive and propietary information. Do NOT redistribute this dataset to other people.**_</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Groups\n",
    "Projects should be done in Groups of 2.  To sign up for a group, go to Canvas and under \"People\", join one of the existing \"Project Groups\".  _For group projects, the project report must state the percentage contribution from each project member._\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "You are free to choose the methodology to solve the task.  In machine learning, it is important to use domain knowledge to help solve the problem.  Hence, instead of blindly applying the algorithms to the data you need to think about how to represent the data in a way that makes sense for the algorithm to solve the task. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation on Kaggle\n",
    "\n",
    "The final evaluation will be performed on Kaggle. See the below code about the evaluation procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** You can only submit 2 times per day to Kaggle!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Each project group needs to give a presentation at the end of the semester.  The presentation time is 8 minutes.  You _must_ give a presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What to hand in\n",
    "You need to turn in the following things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This ipynb file `CourseProject-2018.ipynb` with your source code and documentation. **You should write about all the various attempts that you make to find a good solution.**\n",
    "2. Your final submission file to Kaggle.\n",
    "3. The ipynb file `CourseProject-2018-final.ipynb`, which contains the code that generates the final submission file that you submit to Kaggle. **This code will be used to verify that your Kaggle submission is reproducible.**\n",
    "4. Presentation slides.\n",
    "\n",
    "Files should be uploaded to \"Course Project\" on Canvas.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading\n",
    "The marks of the assignment are distributed as follows:\n",
    "- 40% - Results using various feature representations, dimensionality reduction methods, classifiers, etc.\n",
    "- 20% - Trying out feature representations (e.g. adding/engineering additional features, combining features, time-series features) or methods not used in the tutorials.\n",
    "- 15% - Quality of the written report.  More points for insightful observations and analysis.\n",
    "- 15% - Project presentation\n",
    "- 10% - Final ranking on the Kaggle test data (private leaderboard).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Late Penalty:** 25 marks will be subtracted for each day late.\n",
